Small changes to allow Delphi 7.0 build.


5 July, 2001

Now compatible with Delphi 6.0 and 5.01.


14 March, 2001

I have run the server through the compliance test tool.  I made the needed changes to pass the
test.  It now passes with just the warning(s) in data types.  I have been told the test will be
changed in the next version of the test tool.  I used version 1.0.1070 of the Compliance Test
Tool.

One of the changes was to revert back to "flat" data storage.  I have done a real hierarchical
system and I did not have the time to implement it in this example.  I also added the calls to
prevent an error when terminating the example while clients are connected.  I also incorporated
the new headers Mike created.

Enjoy.

Changed the browse method to "OPC_NS_HIERARCHIAL" which led to some other changes in data
storage and collection.

Added support for multiple clients.

I wrote this server code when I was learning COM and OPC.  Errors in the code may be present and
my interpretation/implementation of the specification for OPC Data Access 2.03, July 27, 1999
may also contain FUBARs.  If you find any discrepancies or plain old errors please let me know
what you found.

This code is released with the purpose:  give others a working example of how to write an OPC
server using Delphi and OOP.  It is intended to be an aid in learning how to write a server.
It is not intended to be a template or a base for a product.  If you wish to include any of this
code in a product please contact Fire and Safety International, Systems, Inc.

OOP is a great language and Delphi is a wonderful product for implementing OPC.

Several people helped with an example or just an ear and a comment.  I have never shaken hands
with any of these guys.  I say to them "Thank you".

I tested the server with a program named Visual OPCTest Client.  It is a great program.
